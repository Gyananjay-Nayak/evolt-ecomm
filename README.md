# React App Setup and Basic Instructions

This React app is created using Create React App, a popular tool for bootstrapping React projects. Below are some basic instructions to get started with the project.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```
Then navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd ecomm
or
cd <project-directory>
```
Install dependencies using npm or yarn:
```bash
npm install
```
Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

```bash
npm start
```
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

```bash
npm run build
```
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the deployment section for more information.

```bash
npm run eject
```
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

Ejecting from Create React App allows you to customize the build tool and configuration choices. However, it's irreversible, and you'll be responsible for maintaining all dependencies and configurations.

### Code Styling
This project uses ESLint and Prettier for code linting and formatting. Make sure to follow the coding guidelines to maintain consistency throughout the project.
